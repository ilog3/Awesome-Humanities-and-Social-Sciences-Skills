description: Use after descriptive statistics when an education research project needs hypothesis testing or statistical relationships, including t-tests, ANOVA/ANCOVA, chi-square tests, correlations, linear/logistic regression, simple mediation/moderation screening, effect sizes, assumptions, post-hoc tests, and APA/Chinese education paper result reporting. This second-layer execution skill supports quantitative, mixed-methods, experimental, quasi-experimental, survey, program evaluation, and action research studies.

# Education Inferential Statistics

## Goal

Choose, run, interpret, and report common inferential analyses aligned to education research questions, variable types, and study design.

## Use After

Use after:

- `education-descriptive-statistics`
- `education-quantitative-data-cleaning`
- `education-quantitative-study-design`
- `education-program-evaluation`
- `education-mixed-methods-design`

Do not expose the skill name to users. Present it as "假设检验与统计推断".

## Inputs

- Research questions/hypotheses
- Cleaned dataset
- Variable roles and types
- Group/timepoint structure
- Descriptive statistics
- Planned design: survey, experiment, quasi-experiment, pre-post, evaluation

## Workflow

1. Map each hypothesis to variables:
   - outcome/dependent variable
   - predictor/independent variable
   - group/timepoint
   - covariates/controls
2. Select analysis based on question and variable type.
3. Check assumptions:
   - independence
   - normality/large-sample robustness
   - homogeneity of variance
   - linearity
   - multicollinearity
   - expected cell counts for chi-square
4. Run the analysis.
5. Calculate effect size:
   - Cohen's d
   - eta squared / partial eta squared
   - odds ratio
   - r
   - standardized beta where useful
6. Interpret results:
   - statistical significance
   - effect size
   - confidence interval
   - educational/practical meaning
7. Draft result paragraph and table.
8. Warn about overclaiming or method mismatch.

## Method Selection Guide

| Research Question | Variables | Recommended Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| Do two independent groups differ? | Categorical group + continuous outcome | Independent-samples t-test |
| Did the same students improve from pre to post? | Paired timepoints + continuous outcome | Paired-samples t-test |
| Do 3+ groups differ? | Multi-group categorical predictor + continuous outcome | One-way ANOVA |
| Do groups differ after controlling baseline? | Group + continuous outcome + covariate | ANCOVA / regression |
| Are two categorical variables associated? | Two categorical variables | Chi-square test |
| Are two continuous variables related? | Two continuous/ordinal scale variables | Pearson/Spearman correlation |
| Which factors predict outcome? | Continuous/categorical predictors + continuous outcome | Linear regression |
| Which factors predict binary outcome? | Predictors + binary outcome | Logistic regression |
| Does relationship vary by group? | Predictor x moderator | Moderation regression |
| Does one variable explain a pathway? | IV -> mediator -> DV | Mediation analysis |

## Education-Specific Guidance

- For class-based interventions, check whether students are nested within classes.
- For pre/post quasi-experiments, prefer ANCOVA/regression controlling for pretest when comparing posttest.
- For small samples, emphasize effect size and confidence intervals; avoid strong claims.
- For nonrandomized designs, avoid saying "caused" unless design supports it.
- For Likert items, analyze scale scores rather than single items where possible.
- For multiple outcomes, consider multiple-comparison risk.

## Quality Rules

- Do not choose a statistical test only because it is familiar.
- Match test to variable type and design.
- Report effect sizes, not only p-values.
- Statistical significance is not educational importance.
- Correlation/regression does not prove causation.
- If assumptions are badly violated, recommend alternatives or robust methods.

## User-Facing Closure

End by routing to interpretation or next analysis:

```text
统计检验结果可以进入论文“结果”部分了。接下来我可以帮你做三件事：A. 生成结果表，B. 写结果段落，C. 继续做信效度/中介调节/高级模型。你想先看哪一步？
