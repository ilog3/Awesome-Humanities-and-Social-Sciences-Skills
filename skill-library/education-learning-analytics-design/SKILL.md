# Education Learning Analytics Design

## Goal

Turn platform/log/behavior data into a rigorous education research design.

## Inputs

- Data source: LMS, AI platform, app logs, assignments, assessments, clickstream
- Outcome of interest
- Unit of analysis: student, session, class, school, item
- Time window
- Privacy constraints

## Workflow

1. Define research questions and unit of analysis.
2. Build data dictionary.
3. Plan cleaning, anonymization, and feature engineering.
4. Select analysis type: descriptive, clustering, prediction, sequence, causal inference.
5. Plan validation and interpretability.
6. Design visualizations/dashboards if needed.
7. Draft methods and limitations.

## Tool Calls

Python:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels seaborn matplotlib shap
```

R:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "tidymodels", "lme4", "TraMineR"))
```

Tools:

```text
Jupyter, RStudio, Orange, Weka, Power BI, Tableau
```

## Output Format

| Data Field | Meaning | Feature Engineering | Privacy Risk |
|---|---|---|---|

Include:

- Data dictionary
- Feature plan
- Modeling plan
- Evaluation metrics
- Ethics/privacy checklist

## Quality Rules

- Avoid black-box prediction without educational interpretation.
- Do not use identifiable student data without anonymization and consent.
- Define leakage risks when predicting outcomes.
