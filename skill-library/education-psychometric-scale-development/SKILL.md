# Education Psychometric Scale Development

## Goal

Design and validate scales, tests, questionnaires, rubrics, or educational measurement instruments.

## Inputs

- Construct definition
- Target population
- Item pool or dimensions
- Response format
- Pilot/validation sample plan
- Existing theory/scales

## Workflow

1. Define construct and dimensions.
2. Generate item pool and expert review plan.
3. Plan pilot testing and item analysis.
4. Plan reliability: Cronbach alpha, omega, test-retest, inter-rater if relevant.
5. Plan validity: content, structural, convergent, discriminant, criterion.
6. Choose EFA/CFA/IRT/invariance analyses.
7. Draft measurement paper method/results templates.

## Tool Calls

R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("psych", "lavaan", "semTools", "mirt", "ltm", "TAM", "GPArotation"))
```

```

## Output Format

| Stage | Task | Output |
|---|---|---|

Include:

- Construct map
- Item generation table
- Expert validity form
- Pilot analysis plan
- EFA/CFA/IRT plan
- Reporting template

## Quality Rules

- Do not claim validity as a property of a scale in general; state validity evidence for a use/context.
- Separate item development sample and validation sample when feasible.
- Match sample size to model complexity.
